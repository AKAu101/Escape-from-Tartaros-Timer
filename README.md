# Escape from Tartarus - Four-Player Chess Clock ‚è±Ô∏è

A web-based four-player chess clock for the board game "Escape from Tartarus" - precise time management for your epic underworld adventure.

## Motivation

During the development of "Escape from Tartarus," I realized that the time-based gameplay requires precise timekeeping. Standard chess clocks are unsuitable for four players, and phone timers are cumbersome to operate. That's why I developed this specially adapted web app.

## What makes this project special?

- **Four separate timers** - Simultaneous timekeeping for all players
- **Game-specific features** - Adapted to "Escape from Tartarus" rules
- **Easy operation** - Large buttons, clear displays
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and smartphone
- **No installation** - Usable directly in the browser
- **Integrated game instructions** - Rules always at hand
